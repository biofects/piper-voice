This project demonstrates how to prepare and train a custom TTS voice using Piper, starting from a Hugging Face .parquet dataset.

I hope I remembered everything I have done.

## 📥 How to Use the Trained Voice

Download the following files:

- `biofects_prime.onnx`

This voice is **English-only** for now.
