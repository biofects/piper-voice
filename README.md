# 🗣️ My First Piper TTS Voice Training

Welcome to my **very first attempt** at training a custom voice using [Piper TTS](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) — an open-source, fast, and high-quality text-to-speech engine.

After **26 hours** of training, here's the result! 🎉

## 🛠️ My Training Setup

- **Engine**: [Piper TTS](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper)
- **Training Time**: ~26 hours
- **Hardware**: *i7-13700K,  4090, 32GB ram*
- **Dataset**: [Optimus Prime Voicelines (Hugging Face)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/srinivasbilla/optimus_prime_voicelines_hf)  
  A huge thanks to [srinivasbilla](https://huggingface.co/srinivasbilla) for providing this fantastic dataset of Optimus Prime voice lines.

## 🌱 Why I Did This

I’ve always been fascinated by voice synthesis and wanted to try building a voice model from scratch using open tools. This project gave me the chance to learn about:

- Dataset cleaning and formatting
- Training large TTS models with Piper
- Voice evaluation and improvement
- This voice is English-only for now.

---

## 🔮 What's Next?

- Improve audio quality through better preprocessing
- Adjust pronunciation and timing
- Experiment with additional datasets and multilingual voices
- Share the trained model for others to try
